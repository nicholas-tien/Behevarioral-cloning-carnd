# Behevarioral-cloning-carnd
Train a model to drive car like a human.This project is from udacity self-driving car project.The aim is to train a model
that can drive a car like a human.It mainly use convolutional neural network to predict the steering angle.

##Denpencies
- Keras
- Opencv
- sklearn

##Data
We can use the dataset provided by udacity.Or we can collect our own dataset by using the simulator provided by udacity.
At first I collected my own dataset.But the result is not good.Maybe my driving skill is bad.So I use the datacity data.
Its result is good.
